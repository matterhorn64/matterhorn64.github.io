    <p>Android: Netrunner. A competitive card game on its third incarnation, currently piloted by a grassroots fan organization.
      Netrunner is a game of:

      <u1>
        <li>Timing</li>
        <li>Asymmetry</li>
        <li>Bluffing</li>
        <li>Risk</li>
      </u1> </p>

    <p>The game asks a lot of its new players, but at its best is a thrill ride that will pull you in deeper each time you play. 
      <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/">Constructing your own deck</a> and piloting it against your opponents is a joy, and learning to tune it opens up new 
      opportunities to improve. I wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone with any interest in cyberpunk.</p>
